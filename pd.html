        <h2>Twelve Pillars by Jim Rohn and Chris Widener</h2>
        <p> The story starts off with a guy who is forty years old, married to his wife<br>
            of 15 years that he no longer is very connected with, and two kids who he barely<br>
            sees. And a boring job where he makes about 40K as a sales rep.<br>
            This story holds many values that can be used in everyday life.</p>
        <br>
        
        <h3>Pillar #4:The major reason for setting a goal is for what it make of you to accomplish it</h3>

        <p> "Goal setting is deciding where you want to go and then designing a plan to get you there.<br>
            Setting goals that stretch you and make you do things differently is what will lead you to a<br>
            future that you want.  Don’t wait for people to set goals for you."</p>
        <p> This resonates with me because I've sometimes, like almost anybody in life have felt stuck<br>
            doing the same routine perpetually and grown tiresome of it. Setting goals for myself helps<br>
            for me to naturally give myself a purpose instead of just existing and floating like a kite<br>
            in the wind not knowing to where the it will take me.</p>
        <p> Whethere it be as miniscule as doing 10 pushups in the morning or going on runs every once<br>
            in a while, it brings me closer and closer to whatever my end goal might be.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Pillar #5:  Everyday has many opportunities, but only one best opportunity.</h3>
        <p> "We all must suffer from one of two pains: the pain of discipline or the pain of regret.<br>
            The difference is that discipline weighs ounces and regret weights tons.  Your best<br>
            opportunity each day are those that align with your overall goals and should be what <br>
            you spend your time on. Don’t just go through the day, get from the day. Don’t spend you time on urgent, <br>
            spend your time on what is important. We must be our own designer of our lives."</p>
        <p> For me, I completely agree with this quote, to make the most out of my time throughout the day,<br>
            it shoud be occupied by finding ways to accomplish my goals or breaking what I thought my limit is.<br>
            Overall becoming better by doing what I truly want. The feeling of regret is worse than the feeling<br>
            of discipline. My understanding what discipline is from the text is eliminating all distractions<br>
            and focusing on the process itself and enjoying the journey to its fullest knowing that what I'm doing<br>
            is in fact fulfilling.</p>
        <br>
            
        <h3>Pillar #6:  Don’t join an easy crowd; you wont grow. Go where the expectations and the demands to perform are high.</h3>
        <p> "Ask yourself these questions:  Who am I around?  What effect are they having on me? What have they got me reading?<br>
            What have they got me saying? Where do they have me going? What do they have me thinking? And most importantly, <br>
            what do they have me becoming? Then ask yourself the final question: is that okay?"</p>
        <p> If I surround myself with those who's goals and values arent in alignment with mine then I'll always be influenced<br>
            or distracted from what I'm doing. Answering those questions makes you realize how much valkue certain people in<br>
            your life have. Ive heard this many times,"Show me your friends and Ill tell you who you are.", and it is a true<br>
            statement due to the fact that if you are surrounded by those who waste their time, you will also waste your time,<br>
            likewise if you surround yourself with productive individuals, you yourself will be productive.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Pillar #7:  Formal education will make you a living.  Self education will make you a fortune.</h3>
        <p> Self-education is what you teach yourself.  It is what you learn along the way so that you are constantly<br>
            improving and growing. Most people don’t continue to learn and grow, to separate yourself from everyone else,<br>
            be focused on continuous learning.</p>
        <p> I've always been somebody who is curious and whatever it is that peaks my interest, I'll find a way get to it<br>
            or get information about it. From reading books made for my own personal development, my knowledge of self exceeds<br>
            that of some of my peers. People say you can't teach an old dog new tricks but I believe no matter what age I may be<br>
            that itch of curiosity will stay with me until I get to omy death bed. Not even just books, it may be even traveling<br>
            and learning about a new culture. There is so much knowledge just at our finger tips so why should I not let my<br>
            curiosity take over?</p>
        <br>
        <p> I can truly say that overall this book has many lessons that can be in corporated into anyones day-to-day</p>
