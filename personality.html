        <h1>My Personality</h1>
        <h1>Who I am....</h1>
        <hr color=black>
        <h2>Personality Traits and how they affected my School life</h2>
        <p> My strongest personality trait would be my creativity.<br>
            Always being able to find a way to get what I want done<br>
            no matter the given time frame. This really helped me alot<br>
            throughout prep school, high school and even now being at Utech.<br>
            The emotion that I believe I portray the most is my carefree<br>
            outlook on life which also ties into my genuine nature as a person.
            As far as hobbies are concerned, I love playing basketball<br>
            and listening to Rhythm & Blues.</p>
        <p> Coming to Utech, one of my biggest issues was adapting to a new environment,<br>
            a new schedule and needing a new mindset to make it to the finish line.<br>
            Because of my creativity which was always inspired by my curiosity,<br>
            I've always been able to keep my mind motivated and moving because<br>
            of my interest in the Degree I'm persuing. I've also been able to find<br>
            those around me whom I have a connection with while being here so far.</p>
        
        <h2>My Hero</h2>
        <p>My idol/hero would be Kyrie Irving.</p>
        <img src="kyrieirving.jpg">
        <p> Kyrie Irving is an NBA basketball player who was first drafted by the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2011/<br>
            He was born on March 23,1992, a day before mine. Widely known for playing his point guard position for the Cleveland<br>
            Cavaliers and winning a Championship back in 2016. Ironically enough, Kyrie Irving is 11 letters long<br>
            He was born at 1:11, his father, Drederick Irving wore the number 11, which Kyrie now wears for the<br>
            Dallas Mavericks. He also scored his 11,000th point on March 11.</p>
        <p> I chose him because of what I see that he stands by and the certain level of positivity he brings<br>
            with him. He is also my favorite NBA play but that wasn't the only reason I chose him.</p>
        <p> My favorite Quote by him is "Greatness is not meant for a few chosen people, its meant for<br>
            those who persistently persue their dreams and make that choice everyday when they wake up."</p>

        <p>I did the MOTIVES personality test and here are my results</p>
        <img src="personality.jpg">

        <p> I've never been interested in personality tests but I can say for certain that it wasn't completely accurate<br>
            I feel as though I know myself enough to the point where a personality test shouldn't determine who I am to<br>
            myself.</p>
